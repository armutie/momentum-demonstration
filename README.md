This is a repository where I applied my physics knowledge from high school into python, visualized through Pygame. 

For the Spider-Man file, hold spacebar and see the velocity vector change as the pendulum swings. Leave the spacebar to see an accurate representation of how the object at the end of the pendulum would move. 

For the momentum file, you will be prompted to enter mass and velocity values, with an option to add friction. Once done, a simulation will be displayed with two rectangular boxes showing the essence of momentum.

The falling.py file is a simple program that makes an object fall down. Press spacebar to make it jump up, and it will always fall back to the ground.
